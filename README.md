# README

From "Learn Python the hard way":

Do the following before every session (before you start the
timer):

1. Get your computer ready and make sure you are ready to go.

2. Read the description of the task and write down notes. This is your research phase and you
   need to gather as much information as you can in written form.

3. Take your research and turn it into a TODO list of what you need to do to implement the hack.
   Write down everything you can think of for the task. What files will you need to make? What
   directories? What features? What libraries will you use?

Once you have the TODO list you are ready to start the timer. During your hacking session you will then
do this:

1. Pick the first simplest task on your TODO and do it. Do you need a file? Make it! Do you need a directory? Make it!
2. Check that what you just did works.
3. Cross that task off and do the next one.
